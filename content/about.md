In my projects, I mostly prefer to work with the following technology stack:

- Go
- Docker
- PostgreSQL
- Redis
- Kafka
- Prometheus

I’m familiar with a variety of tools and frameworks, and I’m always eager to explore new technologies and expand my skill set.

I have practical experience in developing APIs, command-line tools, and web applications using various programming languages. I’m skilled at containerizing applications with **Docker**, designing and working with both **SQL** and **NoSQL** databases, and implementing basic testing and security measures for code.

One of my standout projects is the [Dotfiles Collector](https://github.com/chtozamm/dotfiles-collector) 💻 — a command-line application that makes backing up configuration files a breeze, featuring a user-friendly and visually appealing terminal user interface (TUI).

Before diving into **Go**, I built web applications using **TypeScript**, **React**, **Next.js**, along with modern **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** libraries. A notable project from that time is [Annyknits](https://github.com/chtozamm/annyknits) 🧶 — a customizable counter that includes memory functionality, a split-screen feature for displaying two counters at once, and the option to install it as a Progressive Web App (PWA).

Currently, I’m diving into the world of **DevOps**, learning how to orchestrate containerized applications with Kubernetes, create CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions and Jenkins, and set up monitoring systems with Prometheus and Grafana.

🌐 I'm fluent in both English and Russian, and in my spare time, I'm learning Italian and Norwegian.

🌳 Beyond the tech realm, I have a passion for music, photography, and design. I also enjoy studying the sciences, exploring nature and wildlife, and traveling to new places.
